/*•	The class BankCustomer: is a subclass to Human. It has one attribute customerAccounts,
 *  which is an ArrayList<BankAccount>. It has a constructor that takes a String name and an
 *   int age and calls the constructor of the superclass, i.e. super(name, age). Further, it 
 *   has getters and setters to the attribute customerAccounts. 
Moreover, it four methods: 
•	addAccount(BankAccount bankAccount), that simply adds a bankAccount given as a parameter
 to the ArrayList<BankAccount> customerAccounts, i.e. the attribute of the class.
•	depositToAccount(String accountNumber, double amount): that deposits an amount of money to
 an specific account. You can use the following implementation to it, if you will:
•	withdrawFromAccount(String accountNumber, double amount): that withdraws an amount of money
 from an specific account. The implementation looks like the implementation of 
 depositToAccount(String accountNumber, double amount). Pay attention just that now 
 you are withdrawing money from the account and not depositing!!
•	toString(): That prints the name and the age of a bankCustomer in one line and, after that, the 
information of all accounts that the customer. One account per line. As an example:
                   
When you have implemented your system, test it system with the following Main class:
You should get an output more or less like this:
Also, as a requirement, you should comment well all your code and generate a Javadoc for 
your project. On eclipse, on the top menu “Project-> generate javadoc”.
