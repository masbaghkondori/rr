/*The class Classroom has three attributes:
	classroomName (represented as a String, e.g. “Testautomatisering”)
	classroomTerm (represented as a String, e.g. “Spring 2016”)
	students (represented as an ArrayList<Student>, i.e. an ArrayList of Student objects.)

The class Classroom has a constructor method that takes all the three attributes as parameters:

	public Classroom(String classroomName, String classroomTerm, ArrayList<Student> students){}

The class Classroom has also the getters and setters methods for the three attributes and further three 
methods for handling students that belongs to a classroom. According to the list below:
	setClassroomName(String classroomName)
	setClassroomTerm(String classroomTerm)
	setStudents(ArrayList<Student> students>)
	getClassroomName()
	getClassroomTerm()
	getStudents()
	addANewStudent(Student student)
	removeAStudent(String firstName)
	printFullRelatory()

Further information about the three methods:
1.	addANewStudent(Student student): This method takes a Student object as a parameter and adds the student to the ArrayList<Student> students.
2.	removeAStudent(String firstName). This method takes in a student’s first name and search the student within the array. If the student exists, the student is removed from the list and the method prints out the message “Student”+ #firstName# + ”successfully removed”. Otherwise, the method prints out the message “The student does not exist!”
3.	printFullRelatory(): This method prints out a string that contains the name of the classroom, the term and a list of all students that belong to the class.
